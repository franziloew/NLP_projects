# Natural Language Processing 

This repo contains an overview about my projects using NLP / everything that has to do with the processing of text data.

1. Airbnb reviews (PySpark): In this project I am experimenting with the Apache Spark Framwork for Python (PySpark). I analyse the written reviews of Airbnb Listings in Barcelona. The data comes from the [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) project and is freely available. 

2. [Airbnb description (R)](https://github.com/franziloew/airbnb_textmining): I am curious if the description texts of the Airbnb listings can be used to predict the prices of these listings. In this project I try to integrate the text data into the hedonic price estimation.

[Part 3: Model 2](https://franziloew.github.io/airbnb_textmining/linreg_text.html)


3. Searchengine Keywords (R): I use the search traffic share of keywords to get an idea of the similarity of news provider websites. The search traffic share is the percentage of organic search referrals to this site that come from this keyword. Data comes from [Alexa.com](https://www.alexa.com/) and is not freely available.

	Next Steps:
		- How to measure similarity?
		- Run model on different Datasets.

Other projects in which I work with text data: 

* [Text mining for economists.](https://github.com/franziloew/textmining/tree/gh-pages) Including the state-of-art of my current Paper [Topic and tone of political news articles in German online media.](https://franziloew.github.io/textmining/paper/docs/04_Modelresults_50.html) 

* [Politsentiment (R)](https://github.com/franziloew/politsentiment): Analysing Tweets about German political topics (Repo is in German).
